SIR_Optimal_Control_classes.py          : Script containg the classes used to build up and solve a controlproblem in our case.
SIR_optimal_control_gradient_method.py  : Script implementing a projected gradient method for our control problem.
plotingfunctions.py 			              : Script containing the functions to plot.
main.py                    		          : The main script to control every thing from for the optimization part.

To use optimization part run the main.py script. 
To simulate different vacciation protocoles/strategies use the SIRsolver.m script.
